# RL Gridworld Policy Evaluation

This project demonstrates reinforcement learning on a 5x5 Gridworld using:

- Bellman equations and Iterative Policy Evaluation
- Value Iteration and Policy Extraction
- Monte Carlo Control with Exploring Starts and Îµ-soft policy
- Off-policy Monte Carlo with Importance Sampling

## Folder Structure

- `report/`: LaTeX report and generated figures
- `part1_part2_code/`: Python code for Part 1 and Part 2
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd part1_part2_code
python rl_assignment2.py
```

## To Compile the Report

```bash
cd report
pdflatex rl_assignment2_report.tex
```
